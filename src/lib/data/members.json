She is also affiliated with the Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science, Yale Cancer Center, and Program in Interdisciplinary Neuroscience. Smita's research focuses on developing unsupervised machine learning methods (especially graph signal processing and deep-learning) to denoise, impute, visualize and extract structure, patterns and relationships from big, high throughput, high dimensional biomedical data. Her methods have been applied variety of datasets from many systems including embryoid body differentiation, zebrafish development, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer, lung cancer immunotherapy, infectious disease data, gut microbiome data and patient data.\nSmita teaches three courses: Machine Learning for Biology (Fall), Deep Learning Theory and applications (spring), Advanced Topics in Machine Learning & Data Mining (Spring). She completed her postdoctoral training at Columbia University in the systems biology department where she focused on learning computational models of cellular signaling from single-cell mass cytometry data. She was trained as a computer scientist with a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan's EECS department where her research focused on algorithms for automated synthesis and probabilistic verification of nanoscale logic circuits. Following her time in Michigan, Smita spent 2 years at IBM's TJ Watson Research  Center as a researcher in the systems division where she worked on automated bug finding and error correction in logic."
