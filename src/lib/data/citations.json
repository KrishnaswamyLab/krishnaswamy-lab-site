We examined functional and molecular features of PD-1hi Tregs in healthy subjects and patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), combining functional assays, RNA sequencing, and cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). In both patients with GBM and healthy subjects, circulating PD-1hi Tregs displayed reduced suppression of CD4+ effector T cells, production of IFN-\u03b3, and molecular signatures of exhaustion.

CyTOF analysis of circulating and tumor-infiltrating Tregs from patients with GBM treated with PD-1-blocking antibodies revealed that treatment shifts the profile of circulating Tregs toward a more exhausted phenotype reminiscent of that of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, further increasing IFN-\u03b3 production.

These trends necessitate efficient methods to handle late-stage engineering change orders (ECOs) to the functional specification, often in response to errors discovered after much of the implementation is finished. Past ECO synthesis algorithms have typically treated ECOs as functional errors and applied error diagnosis techniques to solve them. However, error diagnosis methods are primarily geared towards finding a single change, and moreover, tend to be computationally complex. In this paper, we propose a unique methodology that can systematically incorporate human intuition into the ECO process. Our methodology involves finding a set of directly substitutable points known as functional correspondences between the original implementation and the new specification by using name-preserving synthesis and user hints, to diminish the size of the ECO problem. On average, our approach can reduce the size of logic changes by 94% from those reported in current literature. We then incorporate our logic ECO changes into an incremental physical synthesis flow to demonstrate its usability in an industrial setting. Our ECO synthesis methodology is evaluated on high-performance industrial designs. Results indicate that post-ECO worst negative slack (WNS) improved 14% and total negative slack (TNS) improved 46% over pre-ECO. \u00a9 2013 EDAA.", "publisher": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.", "periodical": "Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE", "keywords": ["Engineering Change Order", "Logic Synthesis", "Physical Synthesis"], "urls": [], "volume": 0, "issue": 0, "google_scholar_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=l2Pr9m8AAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=l2Pr9m8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "journal_source": "2013 Design, Automation &Test in Europe Conference &Exhibition (DATE\u00a0\u2026", "cites": 8}, {"title": "Can CAD cure cancer?", "type": "Journal Article", "authors": [{"name": ["Smita", "Krishnaswamy"]}, {"name": ["Bernd", "Bodenmiller"]}, {"name": ["Dana", "Pe'er"]}], "year": "2013", "month": null, "pages": null, "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells have complex regulatory systems that sense adversity (e.g. DNA damage, heat shock, external deathinduction signals) and respond by invoking programmed celldeath or apoptosis.

Using mass cytometry, a high-dimensional technique that can probe multiple signaling nodes at the single-cell level, we interrogate TCR signaling dynamics in control C57BL/6 and autoimmunity-prone nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which show ineffective ERK activation after TCR triggering. By quantitating signals at multiple steps along the signaling cascade and parsing the phosphorylation level of each node as a function of its predecessors, we show that a small impairment in initial pCD3\u0396 activation resonates farther down the signaling cascade and results in larger defects in activation of the ERK1/2-S6 and I\u03baB\u03b1 modules. This nonlinear property of TCR signaling networks, which magnifies small initial differences during signal propagation, also applies in cells from B6 mice activated at different levels of intensity. Impairment in pCD3\u0396 and pSLP76 is not a feedback consequence of a primary deficiency in ERK activation because no proximal signaling defect was observed in Erk2 KO T cells. These defects, which were manifest at all stages of T-cell differentiation from early thymic pre-T cells to memory T cells, may condition the imbalanced immunoregulation and tolerance in NOD T cells.

We sought to determine whether single-cell inhibition data targeting potential mediators of EMT could uncover mechanistic insights into the EMT process.Methods: EMT was artificially induced on Py2T murine breast cancer cells by TGFb treatment. Additionally, a unique drug inhibitor was added to each well of a multiplexed CyTOF experiment. 37 transcription factors and cell surface markers were measured in each cell to assess epithelial and mesenchymal states, SMAD, AKT, and MAPK signaling activity, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis pathway activation. The final single-cell dataset consisted of 300 inhibition and control conditions (cell populations), which we aimed to characterize in relation to one another with respect to effect on EMT.Analyzing the similarity between drug inhibitions amounts to a novel type of clustering problem that involves computing the similarity between diverse cell populations generated by each inhibitor. Traditional methods for comparing cell populations are not robust to the intra-population heterogeneity we observed amongst cells undergoing EMT. Thus, we developed Phenotypic Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (PhEMD). This method for comparing cell populations leverages the insight that only a limited number of \u201ccell subtypes\u201d (e.g. mesenchymal, epithelial, transitional) are observed in unperturbed and perturbed EMT. By classifying each cell as one of these distinct subtypes using community-detection based clustering, PhEMD represents an inhibition or control condition as its relative abundance of each cell subtype. It then uses Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) to compare two relative abundance distributions (i.e. heterogeneous cell populations). PhEMD thus derives a single value representing the dissimilarity between two inhibition conditions. Using PhEMD as measure of dissimilarity between each pair of inhibition and control conditions, we constructed an inhibitor-inhibitor graph and used graph clustering to identify groups of inhibitors that had similar effects to one another.Results: PhEMD analysis revealed that MEK, EGFR and Src inhibitors significantly halted EMT by generating far fewer mesenchymal cells and maintaining a large epithelial cell subpopulation. PhEMD also revealed that different mTOR, PI3K, and Akt inhibitors tended to have similar effects to one another and collectively generated a distinct, transitional cell subpopulation with altered pS6 expression. The pS6 dysregulation may be explained by the fact that ribosomal protein S6 is downstream of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and the intermediate levels of both E-cadherin and vimentin suggest that this subset of cells may have been halted mid-transition. Finally, several Aurora Kinase and CDK inhibitors resulted in a relatively high percentage of apoptotic cells, suggesting these kinases may be important cell cycle regulators in the context of EMT.Citation Format: William S.

Our unsupervised architecture, called SAUCIE (Sparse Autoencoder for Unsupervised Clustering, Imputation, and Embedding), simultaneously performs several key tasks for single-cell data analysis including 1) clustering, 2) batch correction, 3) visualization, and 4) denoising/imputation. SAUCIE is trained to recreate its own input after reducing its dimensionality in a 2-D embedding layer which can be used to visualize the data. Additionally, it uses two novel regularizations: (1) an information dimension regularization to penalize entropy as computed on normalized activation values of the layer, and thereby encourage binary-like encodings that are amenable to clustering and (2) a Maximal Mean Discrepancy penalty to correct batch effects. Thus SAUCIE has a single architecture that denoises, batch-corrects, visualizes and clusters data using a unified representation.

The U1 small nuclear RNP (snRNP) immune complex containing U1 snRNP and anti\u2013U1 snRNP antibodies, which are found in patients with SLE, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, comprising NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase 1, in human monocytes, leading to the production of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). This study was undertaken to investigate the role of the snRNP immune complex in up-regulating the expression of MIF and its interface with the NLRP3 inflammasome. Methods: MIF, IL-1\u03b2, NLRP3, caspase 1, ASC, and MIF receptors were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CytoF) in human monocytes incubated with or without the snRNP immune complex. MIF pathway responses were probed with the novel small molecule antagonist MIF098. Results: The snRNP immune complex induced the production of MIF and IL-1\u03b2 from human monocytes. High-dimensional, single-cell CytoF analysis established that MIF regulates activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, including findings of a quantitative relationship between MIF and its receptors and IL-1\u03b2 levels in the monocytes. MIF098, which blocks MIF binding to its cognate receptor, suppressed the production of IL-1\u03b2, the up-regulation of NLRP3, which is a rate-limiting step in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the activation of caspase 1 in snRNP immune complex\u2013stimulated human monocytes. Conclusion: The U1 snRNP immune complex is a specific stimulus of MIF production in human monocytes, with MIF having an upstream role in defining the inflammatory characteristics of activated monocytes by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and downstream IL-1\u03b2 production.

We tackle the challenging problem of image-to-image translation where the domains are defined by high-level shapes and contexts, as well as including significant clutter and heterogeneity. For this purpose, we introduce a novel GAN based on preserving intra-domain vector transformations in a latent space learned by a siamese network. The traditional GAN system introduced a discriminator network to guide the generator into generating images in the target domain. To this two-network system we add a third: a siamese network that guides the generator so that each original image shares semantics with its generated version.

Materials/Methods Patients with metastatic NSCLC and two or more measurable lesions were eligible. Histologic analysis of biopsy samples was performed at enrollment, and the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was given a qualitative score between 0-3. If patients had progressed on prior anti-PD-1 therapy at the time of enrollment they received SBRT up front and continued on pembrolizumab. If patients were immunotherapy na\u00efve, they were enrolled and received pembrolizumab q3 weeks until disease progression, at which point they received SBRT and continued pembrolizumab. The systemic response to radiotherapy was evaluated using RECIST v 1.1 criteria (with omission of the radiated lesion). The overall response rate after SBRT was defined as the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The disease control rate was defined as the percentage of patients achieving a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). Adverse events were measured using the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v4. Mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) was performed on the peripheral blood of a subset of patients. Results 56 NSCLC patients enrolled in the phase II portion of the study. 50 patients were immunotherapy na\u00efve and began pembrolizumab on trial. Of these 50 patients, 16 experienced disease progression and were deemed suitable candidates for SBRT. 6 patients had progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy at enrollment and received SBRT up front. Of the 22 patients allocated to SBRT, 21 completed treatment. The addition of SBRT to pembrolizumab resulted in a mean of 150.67 days before further disease progression. The disease control rate was 57.14%. There were 2 patients (9.52%) who achieved a PR sustained for > 1 year. There were 10 patients (47.62%) who achieved SD after SBRT. Patients with elevated TIL scores (2-3) showed improved progression free survival (PFS) when compared with patients that had lower TIL scores (0-1), with a mean of 215 versus 59 days respectively. Patients with an immune-related adverse event survived longer than patients with no immune-related adverse event, with a mean of 208 versus 88 days. CyTOF analysis showed patients with a systemic PR after SBRT had a population of CD8+ CD127- Ki-67+ CD45RO+ T cells that correlated with response. Conclusion The addition of SBRT after progression on immunotherapy resulted in increased PFS, a systemic response rate of 9.52%, and a disease control rate of 57.14%.

By tracking de novo transformation from normal hematopoietic progenitors expressing an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) oncogene MLL-AF9, we reveal that the cell cycle rate heterogeneity among granulocyte\u2013macrophage progenitors (GMPs) determines their probability of transformation. A fast cell cycle intrinsic to these progenitors provide permissiveness for transformation, with the fastest cycling 3% GMPs acquiring malignancy with near certainty. Molecularly, we propose that MLL-AF9 preserves gene expression of the cellular states in which it is expressed. As such, when expressed in the naturally-existing, rapidly-cycling immature myeloid progenitors, this cell state becomes perpetuated, yielding malignancy. In humans, high CCND1 expression predicts worse prognosis for MLL fusion AMLs. Our work elucidates one of the earliest steps toward malignancy and suggests that modifying the cycling state of the cell-of-origin could be a preventative approach against malignancy. Not all mutated cells become malignant, suggesting additional requirements for transformation.

We found that a small number of TCF1+ tumor-specific CD8+ T cells were present in tumors throughout development.

Finally, TSL CD8 T cells were also present in LNs from lung adenocarcinoma patients, suggesting this population is also relevant in human disease.

Despite the rapid rise in the prevalence of obesity, surprisingly little is known about how it drives tumor progression. Therefore, deciphering these mechanisms is not only a societal imperative but also represents a key untapped target to develop novel strategies for PDAC prevention and therapy. Motivated by this gap in knowledge, we developed a rapid and reversible autochthonous mouse model of obesity-associated PDAC that recapitulates the genetic and histologic features of the human disease. We showed that obesity accelerates pancreatic tumorigenesis, while genetic or dietary weight loss intercepts tumor development, consistent with a causal and reversible role for obesity in early PDAC progression. By analyzing human and murine biospecimens, we defined obesity-driven microenvironmental alterations that foster tumorigenesis rather than new driver mutations, including significant inflammation, fibrosis, and islet adaptation. Specifically, we identified aberrant pancreatic beta cell expression of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) in response to obesity and showed that islet CCK itself promotes oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic cancer. We further observed that CCK expression and tumor progression correlated with hyperglycemia, beta cell dysfunction, and reduced insulin secretion, suggesting that islet adaptations apart from insulin may drive tumorigenesis in obesity. By performing single-cell RNA-sequencing of islets from genetic and diet-induced obesity models, we have further nominated molecular mechanisms of CCK induction in beta cells and are testing their functional role in PDAC progression. Together, our findings argue that PDAC development is driven by local obesity-associated alterations in the tumor microenvironment, implicate a previously unappreciated endocrine-exocrine signaling axis beyond insulin in this process, and highlight the possibility of targeting the endocrine pancreas as a novel approach to intercept pancreatic exocrine tumorigenesis.Citation Format: Cathy Garcia, Jaffarguriqbal Singh, Lauren Lawres, Sherry Agabiti, Daniel B.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) facilitates invasion and migration away from the primary tumor site. However, it is increasingly apparent that the reverse process, the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), enhances metastatic colonization and growth via reacquisition of the epithelial phenotype. With no therapies currently available to stop metastatic tumor growth, we aim to uncover the mechanisms driving the MET towards identifying novel anti-metastatic therapies. We use the 3D in vitro mammosphere model system where single tumor-initiating cells residing in a partial-EMT state develop into a 3D organoid over 30 days. We sampled cells at 5 time points and performed scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to analyze cell states. We develop a novel computational model of cellular development based on the theory of dynamic optimal transport (OT) and continuous normalizing flows. Our model TrajectoryNet is a neural ODE (ordinary differential equation) network that models the gradient of cell state with respect to time continuously over the input space and over time from cross-sectional single-cell data. TrajectoryNet interpolates between collected timepoints and learns a continuous realistic progression that describes cellular evolution in terms of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Key to TrajectoryNet is a unique regularization to penalize the magnitude of the gradient over the flow. We prove this results in dynamic OT, thereby discouraging the neural network from taking circuitous or unrealistic paths. In contrast to TrajectoryNet, pseudotime, and RNA velocity are best at analyzing within a particular timepoint and do not handle large gaps in timepoints. We compare TrajectoryNet to RNA velocity and static OT and show that TrajectoryNet achieves better trajectories in terms of predicting withheld timepoints. Using TrajectoryNet, we identify a continuous ordering of events that occur during MET that show when and how the epithelial cell states begin to emerge. Such a continuous ordering can give rise to causal associations that can be inhibited to alter MET mechanisms. We also differentiate between trajectories that show self-renewal and maintenance of the tumor-initiating cells, and trajectories that revert to an epithelial state. Further we find that only ~10% of the initial seeded cells develop into mammospheres and identify which initial cells have the potential to seed secondary tumors. Hence, we can refine features (gene and epigenetic states) that define aggressive tumor-initiating cells in triple negative breast cancer, as well as their dynamics through the MET in order to find therapeutic targets.Citation Format: Alexander Tong, Beatriz P.

The result is that, as the generator transitions from one realistic image to another, some regions of the noise space correspond to relatively high quality images and other regions correspond to relatively low quality images. To avoid these relatively low quality areas, and allow the generator to optimize the shape of its noise distribution in a data-aware way, we present a novel sampling procedure: alternating (a) the traditional approach of optimizing the generator while holding the noise space sample constant, but then also (b) moving points in the noise space to improve the loss, using the direction of the gradient, while holding the generator parameters constant.

In this study, we found that a small number of TCF1+ tumor-specific CD8+ T cells were present in lung tumors throughout their development. Yet, most intratumoral T cells differentiated as tumors progressed, corresponding with an immunologic shift in the tumor microenvironment (TME) from \u201chot\u201d(T cell inflamed) to \u201ccold\u201d(non\u2013T cell inflamed). By contrast, most tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (dLNs) had functions and gene expression signatures similar to TSL from chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and this population was stable over time despite the changes in the TME. dLN T cells were the developmental precursors of, and were clonally related to, their more differentiated intratumoral counterparts. Our data support the hypothesis that dLN T cells are the developmental precursors of the TCF1+ T cells in tumors that are maintained by continuous migration.

A key molecular pathway, Ca2+ signaling has been implicated as a signal integrator in developing and wounded epithelial tissues[[1][1], [2][2], [3][3], [4][4]]. Yet how stem cells carry out this signaling across a regenerative tissue remains unknown due to significant challenges in studying signaling dynamics in live mice, limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of stem cell communication during homeostasis. To interpret high dimensional signals that have complex spatial and temporal patterns, we combined optimized imaging of Ca2+ signaling in thousands of epidermal stem cells in living mice with a new machine learning tool, Geometric Scattering Trajectory Homology (GSTH). Using a combination of signal processing, data geometry, and topology, GSTH captures patterns of signaling at multiple scales, either between direct or distant stem cell neighbors. Here we show that epidermal stem cells display dynamic intercellular Ca2+ signaling among neighborhoods of up to 10 cells that is surprisingly coordinated and directed through time across a pool of thousands of stem cells. We find that this collective coordination is an emergent property of the stem cell compartment, distinct from excitatory quiescent neuronal tissues. We demonstrate that cycling stem cells, specifically G2 cells, govern homeostatic patterns of Ca2+ signaling. Stem cells in different cell cycle stages dynamically regulate localization of the gap junction component Connexin43 (Cx43). Lastly, we uncouple global from local communication and identify Cx43 as the molecular mediator necessary for connectivity between local signaling neighborhoods. This work provides resolution in how stem cells at different stages of the cell cycle communicate and how that diversity of phases is essential for tissue wide communication and signaling flow during epidermal regeneration. Our approach provides a framework to investigate stem cell populations and their signaling dynamics, previously not possible.\n### Competing Interest Statement\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.\n [1]: #ref-1\n [2]: #ref-2\n [3]: #ref-3\n [4]: #ref-4", "publisher": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "periodical": "bioRxiv", "keywords": [], "urls": [{"href": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464066v4"}, {"href": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464066v4.abstract"}], "volume": 464066, "issue": 0, "google_scholar_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=l2Pr9m8AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=l2Pr9m8AAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC", "journal_source": "Biorxiv, 2021.10. 12.", "cites": 1}, {"title": "Multimodal Data Visualization and Denoising with Integrated Diffusion", "type": "Journal Article", "authors": [{"name": ["Manik", "Kuchroo"]}, {"name": ["Abhinav", "Godavarthi"]}, {"name": ["Alexander", "Tong"]}, {"name": ["Guy", "Wolf"]}, {"name": ["Smita", "Krishnaswamy"]}], "year": "2021", "month": null, "pages": null, "abstract": "We propose a method called integrated diffusion for combining multimodal data, gathered via different sensors on the same system, to create a integrated data diffusion operator.

Previous studies which focused on mucosal responses cannot explain the observed effects of HSV-2 on HIV PVLs. We sought to determine mechanisms by which HSV-2 increases HIV PVLs. CD4 T cells are recruited to sites of HSV-2 lesions and HSV-2 can infect these cells. Phenotyping of CD4 cells infected with HSV-2 in vitro suggested a preference for T follicular helper cells, an HIV latent reservoir. HSV infection of latently infected Jurkat-2D10 cells resulted in a 10-fold increase in HIV ltr expression. After exposing CD4 cells from HIV+ donors to HSV-2, HIV p24 was detected only in cells expressing HSV-2 glycoprotein B (gB), a marker of productive HSV-2 infection. Bulk and single cell RNAseq on FACS-purified, HSV-infected and uninfected CD4 cells demonstrated reduced expression of HIV restriction factors in HSV+ cells; HSV exposed but uninfected cells exhibited higher expression of interferon response genes, potentially explaining their resistance to HIV reactivation. HSV+ cells exhibited increased expression of the lncRNA MALAT1, which may promote HIV reactivation through epigenetic modification, and HSV infection of 2D10 and CD4 cells led to decreased histone deacetylase activity. Transfection of 2D10 cells with HSV protein VP16 resulted in significantly increased HIV ltr and MALAT1 gene expression, and reduced epigenetic silencing marks. HIV proteins were also increased by proteomic analyses. These findings identify several mechanisms by which HSV-2 directly triggers HIV reactivation, such as the up-regulation of the lncRNA MALAT1.Supported by grants from the NIH (R01 AI134367,\u00a0T32 AI007501,\u00a0T32 GM007288)", "publisher": "American Association of Immunologists", "periodical": "The Journal of Immunology", "keywords": [], "urls": [{"href": "https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/208/1_Supplement/182.40/237133/HSV-2-increases-replication-of-HIV-in-human-T"}], "volume": 40, "issue": "1_Supplement", "google_scholar_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=l2Pr9m8AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=l2Pr9m8AAAAJ:lYAcb2jw7qUC", "journal_source": "The Journal of Immunology 208 (1_Supplement), 182.40-182.", "cites": 0}, {"title": "Multi-view manifold learning of human brain state trajectories", "type": "Journal Article", "authors": [{"name": ["Erica", "L.", "Busch"]}, {"name": ["Jessie", "Huang"]}, {"name": ["Andrew", "Benz"]}, {"name": ["Tom", "Wallenstein"]}, {"name": ["Guillaume", "Lajoie"]}, {"name": ["Guy", "Wolf"]}, {"name": ["Smita", "Krishnaswamy"]}, {"name": ["Nicholas", "B.", "Turk-Browne"]}], "year": "2022", "month": "10", "pages": "2022.05.03.490534", "abstract": "The complexity and intelligence of the brain give the illusion that measurements of brain activity will have intractably high dimensionality, rife with collection and biological noise.

Various epidemiologic studies have shown that obesity increases the risk of PDAC. With rising rates of obesity worldwide, it is imperative that we understand the mechanisms by which obesity promotes PDAC progression. Therefore, to study the effect of obesity on PDAC, we combined a well-established genetic model of obesity (Lepob/ob) with a faithful oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic cancer model (KC: Pdx1-Cre; KrasLSL-G12D/+) and showed that obese mice had both increased tumor burden and shortened survival compared to their lean counterparts. Strikingly, weight loss (via AAV-leptin rescue or caloric restriction), decreased tumor development, demonstrating that the tumor-promoting effects of obesity can be reversed. Bulk-RNA sequencing of tumors from obese mice exhibited aberrant expression of islet beta-cell genes, including those coding for the peptide hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and amylin (Iapp). Single-cell RNA sequencing of islet beta-cells from wild-type, high fat diet-fed, and Lepob/ob mice revealed a trajectory of beta-cell adaptation to obesity with dysregulated hormone expression, including downregulation of insulin expression and upregulation of CCK and Iapp, concordant with loss of beta-cell identity transcription factors and beta-cell dysfunction. In silico analyses using dynamic optimal transport (TrajectoryNet) demonstrate that CCK-expressing beta-cells arise from pre-existing insulin low-expressing beta-cells, arguing for baseline beta-cell heterogeneity as a determinant of aberrant hormone expression. Lastly, transgenic expression of CCK or Iapp in beta-cells was sufficient to promote oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis, while converse beta-cell ablation impeded tumor progression in mice. Together, these results uncover a novel mechanism of obesity driven PDAC by local hormonal signaling between endocrine islets and exocrine acinar cells and reveal pancreatic endocrine adaptations that could be targeted to halt exocrine tumorigenesis.Citation Format: Cathy C.

To advance our understanding of CTCL development and identify potential therapeutic targets, we performed integrative analyses of paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells from CTCL patients to reveal disease unifying features. The malignant CD4+ T-cells of CTCL show highly diverse transcriptomic profiles across patients, with most displaying a mature Th2 differentiation and T-cell exhaustion phenotype. TCR-CDR3 peptide prediction analysis suggested limited diversity between CTCL samples, consistent with a role for a common antigenic stimulus. PHATE affinity-based transition analysis identified putative precancerous circulating populations characterized by an intermediate stage of gene expression and mutation level between the normal CD4+ T-cells and malignant CTCL cells.
