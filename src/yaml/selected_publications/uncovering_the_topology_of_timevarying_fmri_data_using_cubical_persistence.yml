abstract: 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology for

  gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed from fMRI

  measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over time. However,

  analysing such data presents a challenge due to the large degree of noise and

  person-to-person variation in how information is represented in the brain. To

  address this challenge, we present a novel topological approach that encodes

  each time point in an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological

  features, i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation

  naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust to

  noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be clustered to

  find meaningful groupings between participants, and that they are also useful

  in studying within-subject brain state trajectories of subjects performing a

  particular task. Here, we apply both clustering and trajectory analysis

  techniques to a group of participants watching the movie ''Partly Cloudy''. We

  observe significant differences in both brain state trajectories and overall

  topological activity between adults and children watching the same movie.'
