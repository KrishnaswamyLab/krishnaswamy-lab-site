abstract: 'We propose a novel framework for combining datasets via alignment of their

  intrinsic geometry. This alignment can be used to fuse data originating from

  disparate modalities, or to correct batch effects while preserving intrinsic

  data structure. Importantly, we do not assume any pointwise correspondence

  between datasets, but instead rely on correspondence between a (possibly

  unknown) subset of data features. We leverage this assumption to construct an

  isometric alignment between the data. This alignment is obtained by relating

  the expansion of data features in harmonics derived from diffusion operators

  defined over each dataset. These expansions encode each feature as a function

  of the data geometry. We use this to relate the diffusion coordinates of each

  dataset through our assumption of partial feature correspondence. Then, a

  unified diffusion geometry is constructed over the aligned data, which can also

  be used to correct the original data measurements. We demonstrate our method on

  several datasets, showing in particular its effectiveness in biological

  applications including fusion of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and

  single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data measured on the same population

  of cells, and removal of batch effect between biological samples.'
