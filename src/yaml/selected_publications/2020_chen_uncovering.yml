abstract: While several tools have been developed to map axes of variation among individual
  cells, no analogous approaches exist for identifying axes of variation among multicellular
  biospecimens profiled at single-cell resolution. For this purpose, we developed
  'phenotypic earth mover's distance' (PhEMD). PhEMD is a general method for embedding
  a 'manifold of manifolds', in which each datapoint in the higher-level manifold
  (of biospecimens) represents a collection of points that span a lower-level manifold
  (of cells). We apply PhEMD to a newly generated drug-screen dataset and demonstrate
  that PhEMD uncovers axes of cell subpopulational variation among a large set of
  perturbation conditions. Moreover, we show that PhEMD can be used to infer the phenotypes
  of biospecimens not directly profiled. Applied to clinical datasets, PhEMD generates
  a map of the patient-state space that highlights sources of patient-to-patient variation.
  PhEMD is scalable, compatible with leading batch-effect correction techniques and
  generalizable to multiple experimental designs. Phenotypic earth mover's distance
  (PhEMD) facilitates the comparison of single-cell experimental conditions, each
  of which is a high-dimensional dataset, and identifies axes of variation among multicellular
  biospecimens.
