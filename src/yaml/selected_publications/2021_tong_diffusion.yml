abstract: "We propose a new fast method of measuring distances between large numbers
  of related high dimensional datasets called the Diffusion Earth Mover's Distance
  (EMD). We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data graph that
  is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In such cases
  where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Rieman-nian closed manifold,
  we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with
  a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed i\xF1 O(n) time and is
  more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show
  Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future uses in gradient-descent
  frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application
  of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples
  at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients
  on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate
  methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher level
  patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. More generally,
  Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively collected in parallel
  in many medical and biological systems."
