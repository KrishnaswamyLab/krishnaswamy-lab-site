abstract: We propose a method called integrated diffusion for combining multimodal
  data, gathered via different sensors on the same system, to create a integrated
  data diffusion operator. As real world data suffers from both local and global noise,
  we introduce mechanisms to optimally calculate a diffusion operator that reflects
  the combined information in data by maintaining low frequency eigenvectors of each
  modality both globally and locally. We show the utility of this integrated operator
  in denoising and visualizing multimodal toy data as well as multi-omic data generated
  from blood cells, measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our
  approach better visualizes the geometry of the integrated data and captures known
  cross-modality associations. More generally, integrated diffusion is broadly applicable
  to multimodal datasets generated by noisy sensors collected in a variety of fields.
