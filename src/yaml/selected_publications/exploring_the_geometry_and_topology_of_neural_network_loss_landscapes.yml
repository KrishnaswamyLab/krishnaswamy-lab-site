abstract: 'Recent work has established clear links between the generalization

  performance of trained neural networks and the geometry of their loss landscape

  near the local minima to which they converge. This suggests that qualitative

  and quantitative examination of the loss landscape geometry could yield

  insights about neural network generalization performance during training. To

  this end, researchers have proposed visualizing the loss landscape through the

  use of simple dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such visualization

  methods have been limited by their linear nature and only capture features in

  one or two dimensions, thus restricting sampling of the loss landscape to lines

  or planes. Here, we expand and improve upon these in three ways. First, we

  present a novel "jump and retrain" procedure for sampling relevant portions of

  the loss landscape. We show that the resulting sampled data holds more

  meaningful information about the network''s ability to generalize. Next, we show

  that non-linear dimensionality reduction of the jump and retrain trajectories

  via PHATE, a trajectory and manifold-preserving method, allows us to visualize

  differences between networks that are generalizing well vs poorly. Finally, we

  combine PHATE trajectories with a computational homology characterization to

  quantify trajectory differences.'
