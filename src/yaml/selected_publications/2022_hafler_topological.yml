abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a neurodegenerative disease that
  is among the leading causes of blindness worldwide. The molecular pathways that
  lead to chronic inflammation and vision loss in AMD are not well understood. Our
  hypothesis is that functional changes in glia influence neurodegeneration in AMD,
  and these changes may be targeted to halt disease progression and preserve vision.
