abstract: 'Diffusion condensation is a dynamic process that yields a sequence of

  multiscale data representations that aim to encode meaningful abstractions. It

  has proven effective for manifold learning, denoising, clustering, and

  visualization of high-dimensional data. Diffusion condensation is constructed

  as a time-inhomogeneous process where each step first computes and then applies

  a diffusion operator to the data. We theoretically analyze the convergence and

  evolution of this process from geometric, spectral, and topological

  perspectives. From a geometric perspective, we obtain convergence bounds based

  on the smallest transition probability and the radius of the data, whereas from

  a spectral perspective, our bounds are based on the eigenspectrum of the

  diffusion kernel. Our spectral results are of particular interest since most of

  the literature on data diffusion is focused on homogeneous processes. From a

  topological perspective, we show diffusion condensation generalizes

  centroid-based hierarchical clustering. We use this perspective to obtain a

  bound based on the number of data points, independent of their location. To

  understand the evolution of the data geometry beyond convergence, we use

  topological data analysis. We show that the condensation process itself defines

  an intrinsic condensation homology. We use this intrinsic topology as well as

  the ambient persistent homology of the condensation process to study how the

  data changes over diffusion time. We demonstrate both types of topological

  information in well-understood toy examples. Our work gives theoretical

  insights into the convergence of diffusion condensation, and shows that it

  provides a link between topological and geometric data analysis.'
