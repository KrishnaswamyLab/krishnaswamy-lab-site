abstract: 'We present a method called Manifold Interpolating Optimal-Transport Flow

  (MIOFlow) that learns stochastic, continuous population dynamics from static

  snapshot samples taken at sporadic timepoints. MIOFlow combines dynamic models,

  manifold learning, and optimal transport by training neural ordinary

  differential equations (Neural ODE) to interpolate between static population

  snapshots as penalized by optimal transport with manifold ground distance.

  Further, we ensure that the flow follows the geometry by operating in the

  latent space of an autoencoder that we call a geodesic autoencoder (GAE). In

  GAE the latent space distance between points is regularized to match a novel

  multiscale geodesic distance on the data manifold that we define. We show that

  this method is superior to normalizing flows, Schr\"odinger bridges and other

  generative models that are designed to flow from noise to data in terms of

  interpolating between populations. Theoretically, we link these trajectories

  with dynamic optimal transport. We evaluate our method on simulated data with

  bifurcations and merges, as well as scRNA-seq data from embryoid body

  differentiation, and acute myeloid leukemia treatment.'
