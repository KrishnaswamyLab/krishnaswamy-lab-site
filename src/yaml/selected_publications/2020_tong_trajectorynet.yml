abstract: It is increasingly common to encounter data from dynamic processes captured
  by static crosssectional measurements over time, particularly in biomedical settings.
  Recent attempts to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport
  to create pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot
  model continuous dynamics and non-linear paths that entities can take in these systems.
  To address this issue, we establish a link between continuous normalizing flows
  and dynamic optimal transport, that allows us to model the expected paths of points
  over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained, as they
  are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution.
  We present TrajectoryNet, which controls the continuous paths taken between distributions
  to produce dynamic optimal transport. We show how this is particularly applicable
  for studying cellular dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
  technologies, and that TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed static optimal
  transport-based models that can be used for interpolating cellular distributions.
