abstract: Summary Exciting advances in technologies to measure biological systems
  are currently at the forefront of research. The ability to gather data along an
  increasing number of omic dimensions has created a need for tools to analyze all
  of this information together, rather than siloing each technology into separate
  analysis pipelines. To advance this goal, we introduce a framework called the single-cell
  multi-modal generative adversarial network (scMMGAN) that integrates data from multiple
  modalities into a unified representation in the ambient data space for downstream
  analysis using a combination of adversarial learning and data geometry techniques.
  The framework's key improvement is an additional diffusion geometry loss with a
  new kernel that constrains the otherwise over-parameterized GAN. We demonstrate
  scMMGAN's ability to produce more meaningful alignments than alternative methods
  on a wide variety of data modalities and that its output can be used to draw conclusions
  from real-world biological experimental data.
