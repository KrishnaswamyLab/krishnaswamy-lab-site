abstract: "The development of powerful natural language models has improved the ability
  to learn meaningful representations of protein sequences. In addition, advances
  in high-throughput mutagenesis, directed evolution and next-generation sequencing
  have allowed for the accumulation of large amounts of labelled fitness data. Leveraging
  these two trends, we introduce Regularized Latent Space Optimization (ReLSO), a
  deep transformer-based autoencoder, which features a highly structured latent space
  that is trained to jointly generate sequences as well as predict fitness. Through
  regularized prediction heads, ReLSO introduces a powerful protein sequence encoder
  and a novel approach for efficient fitness landscape traversal. Using ReLSO, we
  explicitly model the sequence\u2013function landscape of large labelled datasets
  and generate new molecules by optimizing within the latent space using gradient-based
  methods. We evaluate this approach on several publicly available protein datasets,
  including variant sets of anti-ranibizumab and green fluorescent protein. We observe
  a greater sequence optimization efficiency (increase in fitness per optimization
  step) using ReLSO compared with other approaches, where ReLSO more robustly generates
  high-fitness sequences. Furthermore, the attention-based relationships learned by
  the jointly trained ReLSO models provide a potential avenue towards sequence-level
  fitness attribution information. The space of possible proteins is vast, and optimizing
  proteins for specific target properties computationally is an ongoing challenge,
  even with large amounts of data. Castro and colleagues combine a transformer-based
  model with regularized prediction heads to form a smooth and pseudoconvex latent
  space that allows for easier navigation and more efficient optimization of proteins."
