abstract: "It is currently challenging to analyze single-cell data consisting of many
  cells and samples, and to address variations arising from batch effects and different
  sample preparations. For this purpose, we present SAUCIE, a deep neural network
  that combines parallelization and scalability offered by neural networks, with the
  deep representation of data that can be learned by them to perform many single-cell
  data analysis tasks. Our regularizations (penalties) render features learned in
  hidden layers of the neural network interpretable. On large, multi-patient datasets,
  SAUCIE\u2019s various hidden layers contain denoised and batch-corrected data, a
  low-dimensional visualization and unsupervised clustering, as well as other information
  that can be used to explore the data. We analyze a 180-sample dataset consisting
  of 11 million T cells from dengue patients in India, measured with mass cytometry.
  SAUCIE can batch correct and identify cluster-based signatures of acute dengue infection
  and create a patient manifold, stratifying immune response to dengue. SAUCIE, a
  deep learning platform to analyze single-cell data across samples and platforms,
  allows information to be obtained from the internal layers of the network, which
  provides additional mechanistic understanding that can be used to further tune data
  analysis."
