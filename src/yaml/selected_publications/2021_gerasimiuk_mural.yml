abstract: A major challenge in embedding or visualizing clinical patient data is the
  heterogeneity of variable types including continuous lab values, categorical diagnostic
  codes, as well as missing or incomplete data. In particular, in EHR data, some variables
  are {\em missing not at random (MNAR)} but deliberately not collected and thus are
  a source of information. For example, lab tests may be deemed necessary for some
  patients on the basis of suspected diagnosis, but not for others. Here we present
  the MURAL forest -- an unsupervised random forest for representing data with disparate
  variable types (e.g., categorical, continuous, MNAR). MURAL forests consist of a
  set of decision trees where node-splitting variables are chosen at random, such
  that the marginal entropy of all other variables is minimized by the split. This
  allows us to also split on MNAR variables and discrete variables in a way that is
  consistent with the continuous variables. The end goal is to learn the MURAL embedding
  of patients using average tree distances between those patients. These distances
  can be fed to nonlinear dimensionality reduction method like PHATE to derive visualizable
  embeddings. While such methods are ubiquitous in continuous-valued datasets (like
  single cell RNA-sequencing) they have not been used extensively in mixed variable
  data. We showcase the use of our method on one artificial and two clinical datasets.
  We show that using our approach, we can visualize and classify data more accurately
  than competing approaches. Finally, we show that MURAL can also be used to compare
  cohorts of patients via the recently proposed tree-sliced Wasserstein distances.
