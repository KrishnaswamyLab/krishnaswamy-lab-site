abstract: Current methods for comparing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets collected
  in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state space,
  such as clusters of cells. Here we quantify the effects of perturbations at the
  single-cell level using a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation across
  the transcriptomic space. We describe this space as a manifold and develop a relative
  likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental conditions
  using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used to identify
  cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop vertex
  frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level of granularity
  that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm at identifying
  clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition is, on average,
  57% higher than the next-best-performing algorithm tested. Gene signatures derived
  from these clusters are more accurate than those of six alternative algorithms in
  ground truth comparisons.
