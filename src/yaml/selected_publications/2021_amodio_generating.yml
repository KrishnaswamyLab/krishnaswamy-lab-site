abstract: 'Often when biological entities are measured in multiple ways, there are
  distinct categories of information: some information is easy-to-obtain information
  (EI) and can be gathered on virtually every subject of interest, while other information
  is hard-to-obtain information (HI) and can only be gathered on some. We propose
  building a model to make probabilistic predictions of HI using EI. Our feature mapping
  GAN (FMGAN), based on the conditional GAN framework, uses an embedding network to
  process conditions as part of the conditional GAN training to create manifold structure
  when it is not readily present in the conditions. We experiment on generating RNA
  sequencing of cell lines perturbed with a drug conditioned on the drug''s chemical
  structure and generating FACS data from clinical monitoring variables on a cohort
  of COVID-19 patients, effectively describing their immune response in great detail.'
