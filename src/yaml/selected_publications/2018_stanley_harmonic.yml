abstract: We propose a novel framework for combining datasets via alignment of their
  intrinsic geometry. This alignment can be used to fuse data originating from disparate
  modalities, or to correct batch effects while preserving intrinsic data structure.
  Importantly, we do not assume any pointwise correspondence between datasets, but
  instead rely on correspondence between a (possibly unknown) subset of data features.
  We leverage this assumption to construct an isometric alignment between the data.
  This alignment is obtained by relating the expansion of data features in harmonics
  derived from diffusion operators defined over each dataset. These expansions encode
  each feature as a function of the data geometry. We use this to relate the diffusion
  coordinates of each dataset through our assumption of partial feature correspondence.
  Then, a unified diffusion geometry is constructed over the aligned data, which can
  also be used to correct the original data measurements. We demonstrate our method
  on several datasets, showing in particular its effectiveness in biological applications
  including fusion of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC
  sequencing (scATAC-seq) data measured on the same population of cells, and removal
  of batch effect between biological samples.
