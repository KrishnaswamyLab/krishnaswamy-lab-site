abstract: 'We introduce a new intrinsic measure of local curvature on point-cloud
  data

  called diffusion curvature. Our measure uses the framework of diffusion maps,

  including the data diffusion operator, to structure point cloud data and define

  local curvature based on the laziness of a random walk starting at a point or

  region of the data. We show that this laziness directly relates to volume

  comparison results from Riemannian geometry. We then extend this scalar

  curvature notion to an entire quadratic form using neural network estimations

  based on the diffusion map of point-cloud data. We show applications of both

  estimations on toy data, single-cell data, and on estimating local Hessian

  matrices of neural network loss landscapes.'
