abstract: We introduce a new intrinsic measure of local curvature on point-cloud data
  called diffusion curvature. Our measure uses the framework of diffusion maps, including
  the data diffusion operator, to structure point cloud data and define local curvature
  based on the laziness of a random walk starting at a point or region of the data.
  We show that this laziness directly relates to volume comparison results from Riemannian
  geometry. We then extend this scalar curvature notion to an entire quadratic form
  using neural network estimations based on the diffusion map of point-cloud data.
  We show applications of both estimations on toy data, single-cell data, and on estimating
  local Hessian matrices of neural network loss landscapes.
