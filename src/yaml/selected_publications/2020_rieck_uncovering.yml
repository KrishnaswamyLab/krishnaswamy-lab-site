abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology for
  gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed from fMRI measurements
  result in volumetric data sets that vary over time. However, analysing such data
  presents a challenge due to the large degree of noise and person-to-person variation
  in how information is represented in the brain. To address this challenge, we present
  a novel topological approach that encodes each time point in an fMRI data set as
  a persistence diagram of topological features, i.e. high-dimensional voids present
  in the data. This representation naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence
  and is robust to noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can
  be clustered to find meaningful groupings between participants, and that they are
  also useful in studying within-subject brain state trajectories of subjects performing
  a particular task. Here, we apply both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques
  to a group of participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. We observe significant
  differences in both brain state trajectories and overall topological activity between
  adults and children watching the same movie.
