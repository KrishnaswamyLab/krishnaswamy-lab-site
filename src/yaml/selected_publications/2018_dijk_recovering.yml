abstract: "Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies suffer from many sources of technical
  noise, including under-sampling of mRNA molecules, often termed \u201Cdropout,\u201D
  which can severely obscure important gene-gene relationships. To address this, we
  developed MAGIC (Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells), a method that
  shares information across similar cells, via data diffusion, to denoise the cell
  count matrix and fill in missing transcripts. We validate MAGIC on several biological
  systems and find it effective at recovering gene-gene relationships and additional
  structures. Applied to the epithilial to mesenchymal transition, MAGIC reveals a
  phenotypic continuum, with the majority of cells residing in intermediate states
  that display stem-like signatures, and infers known and previously uncharacterized
  regulatory interactions, demonstrating that our approach can successfully uncover
  regulatory relations without perturbations. A new algorithm overcomes limitations
  of data loss in single-cell sequencing experiments."
