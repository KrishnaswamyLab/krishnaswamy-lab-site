abstract: "Phenotypic plasticity describes the ability of cancer cells to undergo
  dynamic, nongenetic cell state changes that amplify cancer heterogeneity to promote
  metastasis and therapy evasion. Thus, cancer cells occupy a continuous spectrum
  of phenotypic states connected by trajectories defining dynamic transitions upon
  a cancer cell state landscape. With technologies proliferating to systematically
  record molecular mechanisms at single-cell resolution, we illuminate manifold learning
  techniques as emerging computational tools to effectively model cell state dynamics
  in a way that mimics our understanding of the cell state landscape. We anticipate
  that \u201Cstate-gating\u201D therapies targeting phenotypic plasticity will limit
  cancer heterogeneity, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Significance: Nongenetic
  mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity have emerged as significant drivers
  of tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Herein, we discuss new
  experimental and computational techniques to define phenotypic plasticity as a scaffold
  to guide accelerated progress in uncovering new vulnerabilities for therapeutic
  exploitation."
