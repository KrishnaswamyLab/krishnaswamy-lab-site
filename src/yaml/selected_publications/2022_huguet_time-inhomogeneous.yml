abstract: Diffusion condensation is a dynamic process that yields a sequence of multiscale
  data representations that aim to encode meaningful abstractions. It has proven effective
  for manifold learning, denoising, clustering, and visualization of high-dimensional
  data. Diffusion condensation is constructed as a time-inhomogeneous process where
  each step first computes and then applies a diffusion operator to the data. We theoretically
  analyze the convergence and evolution of this process from geometric, spectral,
  and topological perspectives. From a geometric perspective, we obtain convergence
  bounds based on the smallest transition probability and the radius of the data,
  whereas from a spectral perspective, our bounds are based on the eigenspectrum of
  the diffusion kernel. Our spectral results are of particular interest since most
  of the literature on data diffusion is focused on homogeneous processes. From a
  topological perspective, we show diffusion condensation generalizes centroid-based
  hierarchical clustering. We use this perspective to obtain a bound based on the
  number of data points, independent of their location. To understand the evolution
  of the data geometry beyond convergence, we use topological data analysis. We show
  that the condensation process itself defines an intrinsic condensation homology.
  We use this intrinsic topology as well as the ambient persistent homology of the
  condensation process to study how the data changes over diffusion time. We demonstrate
  both types of topological information in well-understood toy examples. Our work
  gives theoretical insights into the convergence of diffusion condensation, and shows
  that it provides a link between topological and geometric data analysis.
