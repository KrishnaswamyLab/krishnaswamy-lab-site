abstract: We present a method called Manifold Interpolating Optimal-Transport Flow
  (MIOFlow) that learns stochastic, continuous population dynamics from static snapshot
  samples taken at sporadic timepoints. MIOFlow combines dynamic models, manifold
  learning, and optimal transport by training neural ordinary differential equations
  (Neural ODE) to interpolate between static population snapshots as penalized by
  optimal transport with manifold ground distance. Further, we ensure that the flow
  follows the geometry by operating in the latent space of an autoencoder that we
  call a geodesic autoencoder (GAE). In GAE the latent space distance between points
  is regularized to match a novel multiscale geodesic distance on the data manifold
  that we define. We show that this method is superior to normalizing flows, Schr\"odinger
  bridges and other generative models that are designed to flow from noise to data
  in terms of interpolating between populations. Theoretically, we link these trajectories
  with dynamic optimal transport. We evaluate our method on simulated data with bifurcations
  and merges, as well as scRNA-seq data from embryoid body differentiation, and acute
  myeloid leukemia treatment.
