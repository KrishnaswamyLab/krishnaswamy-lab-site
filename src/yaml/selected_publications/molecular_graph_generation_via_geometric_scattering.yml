abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used extensively for addressing

  problems in drug design and discovery. Both ligand and target molecules are

  represented as graphs with node and edge features encoding information about

  atomic elements and bonds respectively. Although existing deep learning models

  perform remarkably well at predicting physicochemical properties and binding

  affinities, the generation of new molecules with optimized properties remains

  challenging. Inherently, most GNNs perform poorly in whole-graph representation

  due to the limitations of the message-passing paradigm. Furthermore,

  step-by-step graph generation frameworks that use reinforcement learning or

  other sequential processing can be slow and result in a high proportion of

  invalid molecules with substantial post-processing needed in order to satisfy

  the principles of stoichiometry. To address these issues, we propose a

  representation-first approach to molecular graph generation. We guide the

  latent representation of an autoencoder by capturing graph structure

  information with the geometric scattering transform and apply penalties that

  structure the representation also by molecular properties. We show that this

  highly structured latent space can be directly used for molecular graph

  generation by the use of a GAN. We demonstrate that our architecture learns

  meaningful representations of drug datasets and provides a platform for

  goal-directed drug synthesis.'
