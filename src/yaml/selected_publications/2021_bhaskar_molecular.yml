abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used extensively for addressing problems
  in drug design and discovery. Both ligand and target molecules are represented as
  graphs with node and edge features encoding information about atomic elements and
  bonds respectively. Although existing deep learning models perform remarkably well
  at predicting physicochemical properties and binding affinities, the generation
  of new molecules with optimized properties remains challenging. Inherently, most
  GNNs perform poorly in whole-graph representation due to the limitations of the
  message-passing paradigm. Furthermore, step-by-step graph generation frameworks
  that use reinforcement learning or other sequential processing can be slow and result
  in a high proportion of invalid molecules with substantial post-processing needed
  in order to satisfy the principles of stoichiometry. To address these issues, we
  propose a representation-first approach to molecular graph generation. We guide
  the latent representation of an autoencoder by capturing graph structure information
  with the geometric scattering transform and apply penalties that structure the representation
  also by molecular properties. We show that this highly structured latent space can
  be directly used for molecular graph generation by the use of a GAN. We demonstrate
  that our architecture learns meaningful representations of drug datasets and provides
  a platform for goal-directed drug synthesis.
