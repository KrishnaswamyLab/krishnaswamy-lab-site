abstract: The high-dimensional data created by high-throughput technologies require
  visualization tools that reveal data structure and patterns in an intuitive form.
  We present PHATE, a visualization method that captures both local and global nonlinear
  structure using an information-geometric distance between data points. We compare
  PHATE to other tools on a variety of artificial and biological datasets, and find
  that it consistently preserves a range of patterns in data, including continual
  progressions, branches and clusters, better than other tools. We define a manifold
  preservation metric, which we call denoised embedding manifold preservation (DEMaP),
  and show that PHATE produces lower-dimensional embeddings that are quantitatively
  better denoised as compared to existing visualization methods. An analysis of a
  newly generated single-cell RNA sequencing dataset on human germ-layer differentiation
  demonstrates how PHATE reveals unique biological insight into the main developmental
  branches, including identification of three previously undescribed subpopulations.
  We also show that PHATE is applicable to a wide variety of data types, including
  mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, Hi-C and gut microbiome data. PHATE,
  a new data visualization tool, better preserves patterns in high-dimensional data
  after dimensionality reduction.
