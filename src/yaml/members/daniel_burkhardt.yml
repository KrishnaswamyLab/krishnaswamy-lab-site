about: Daniel earned his B.S. in Microbiology at the University of Massachusetts,
  Amherst in 2015. He studied the effects of simulated climate warming on soil microbial
  communities with Dr. Kristen DeAngelis, and this work became the focus of his senior
  thesis. Daniel joined the PhD program in Genetics at Yale University in 2015. Under
  the mentorship of Smita Krishnaswamy, Daniel has worked on developing unsupervised
  machine learning algorithms for analysis of high dimensional biomedical data. Previous
  projects include manifold learning methods for dimensionality reduction and analysis
  of experimental perturbations and a neural network for archetypal analysis.
