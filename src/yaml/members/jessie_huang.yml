about: 'Jessie Huang is a postdoc in the department of computer science at Yale. She
  is generally interested in machine learning and its applications in medical and
  biological research. She was previously a postdoc in the Reasoning and Learning
  Lab at McGill University in Montreal. Her research at McGill focused on developing
  algorithms to learn robust policies with respect to misspecified rewards in reinforcement
  learning.

  Jessie received her PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan,
  Ann Arbor. She worked as an engineering consultant at Exponent in the San Francisco
  bay area for two years before moving to Montreal. Before machine learning, she studied
  fracture mechanics and statistics and how to utilize the natural failure of materials
  to develop micro-scale tools for biomedical applications'
