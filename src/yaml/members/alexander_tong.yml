about: 'Alex, now at MILA, was a computer science PhD student at Yale University.  His
  research interests are in machine learning and algorithms. Currently, he is working
  on optimal transport methods for single-cell data using a combination of graph and
  deep learning methods.

  Alex grew up in Seattle, Washington. He completed B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer
  science from Tufts University in 2017. He splits his spare time between racing sailboats
  and trail running.'
