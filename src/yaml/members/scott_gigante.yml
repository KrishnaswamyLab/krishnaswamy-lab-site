about: 'Scott was a PhD student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, and jointly
  advised by Smita Krishnaswamy and Ronald Coifman. His research interests include
  deep learning and graph-based methods for the analysis of single-cell genomics data.

  Scott completed his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics & Statistics at the University
  of Melbourne, Australia. Before coming to Yale, Scott was a research technician
  at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, where he developed computational
  methods for detecting and analysing epigenetic modifications to DNA in nanopore
  sequencing. He is now a senior machine learning scientist at Immunai.

  Scott is passionate about open, reproducible science and open source software. In
  his spare time, Scott enjoys singing with the Yale Camerata and cycling with the
  Yale Cycling Team.'
