about: 'Smita Krishnaswamy is an Associate Professor in the department of Genetics
  at the Yale School of Medicine and Department of Computer Science in the Yale School
  of Applied Science and Engineering and a core member of the Program in Applied Mathematics.
  She is also affiliated with the Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science, Yale Cancer
  Center, and Program in Interdisciplinary Neuroscience. Smita''s research focuses
  on developing unsupervised machine learning methods (especially graph signal processing
  and deep-learning) to denoise, impute, visualize and extract structure, patterns
  and relationships from big, high throughput, high dimensional biomedical data. Her
  methods have been applied variety of datasets from many systems including embryoid
  body differentiation, zebrafish development, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  in breast cancer, lung cancer immunotherapy, infectious disease data, gut microbiome
  data and patient data.

  Smita teaches three courses: Machine Learning for Biology (Fall), Deep Learning
  Theory and applications (spring), Advanced Topics in Machine Learning & Data Mining
  (Spring). She completed her postdoctoral training at Columbia University in the
  systems biology department where she focused on learning computational models of
  cellular signaling from single-cell mass cytometry data. She was trained as a computer
  scientist with a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan''s EECS department where
  her research focused on algorithms for automated synthesis and probabilistic verification
  of nanoscale logic circuits. Following her time in Michigan, Smita spent 2 years
  at IBM''s TJ Watson Research  Center as a researcher in the systems division where
  she worked on automated bug finding and error correction in logic.'
