about: I am an Associate Research Scientist at Yale University in the Krishnaswamy Lab and Giraldez Lab. As a computational biologist from a molecular biology lab background, my role bridges computational and biological domains, developing and applying novel tools for biomedical data analysis. I am motivated by the thrill of biological discovery and my fascination with finding coherent patterns within complex data. I love the challenge of communicating science in a way that can connect with the intellect of people from outside my field. The tenets of my career are integrity, enjoyment and discovery.
