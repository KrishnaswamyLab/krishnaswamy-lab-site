about: Scott is an Associate Research Scientist at Yale University in the Krishnaswamy
  Lab and Giraldez Lab. As a computational biologist from a molecular biology lab
  background, his role bridges computational and biological domains, developing and
  applying novel tools for biomedical data analysis. Scott is motivated by the thrill
  of biological discovery and my fascination with finding coherent patterns within
  complex data. He loves the challenge of communicating science in a way that can connect
  with the intellect of people from outside his field. The tenets of Scott's career are
  integrity, enjoyment and discovery.
