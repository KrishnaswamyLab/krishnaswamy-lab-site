about: I am an Associate Research Scientist at Yale University in the Krishnaswamy Lab and Giraldez Lab. A computational biologist with a lab-based molecular biology background, my role bridges computational and biological domains, developing and applying novel tools for biomedical data analysis.  I am motivated by the thrill of biological discovery and my fascination with finding coherent patterns within complex data. The tenets of my career are integrity, enjoyment and discovery. I love the challenge of communicating science in a way that can connect with the intellect of people from outside my field.
