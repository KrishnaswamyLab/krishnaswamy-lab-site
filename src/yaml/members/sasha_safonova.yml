about: Sasha is a PhD student in Astronomy at Yale University, working with Smita
  Krishnaswamy and Nikhil Padmanabhan. Her scientific interests include computational
  cosmology and the large scale structure of the Universe. She is working on harnessing
  machine learning to enhance the connection between theory and observations on the
  largest scales in the Universe. Sasha got her Master's in Physics at Durham University,
  where she created a mock galaxy catalog from cosmological simulations, working with
  Prof. Shaun Cole and Dr. Peder Norberg. Prior to Durham, Sasha majored in physics
  at the University of Arizona and performed research at the SLAC National Accelerator
  Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and MIT's Haystack Observatory.
  She has dedicated many nights to collecting cosmological data at the Kitt Peak National
  Observatory.
