about: 'Manik Kuchroo is an MD candidate at Yale School of Medicine and is interested
  in the intersection of genomics, immunology and oncology. His current projects in
  the lab include developing a novel manifold based clustering algorithm for single
  cell genomics data, understanding tumor infiltrating immune cells developmental
  progression using deep learning and helping characterize interactions in the exoproteome
  using phage and yeast display technologies in collaboration with the Ring lab.

  Manik is originally from Newton, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard College
  with a BA in Neurobiology. Manik''s interest in the intersection of genomics and
  immunology was piqued during his time in Aviv Regev''s Lab at the Broad Institute
  and during his time with Phil De Jager and Nikolaos Patsopoulos at Harvard Medical
  School.

  While not in the lab or in the hospital, Manik loves playing cricket and watching
  TV shows.'
