about: "Guy Wolf received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Tel
  Aviv University in 2009 and 2014, respectively. During his M.Sc. studies he served
  in the Israeli Defense Forces in software design and development roles. Between
  the years 2013 and 2015 he was a post-doctoral researcher in the Computer Science
  Department at \xC8cole Normale Sup\xE9rieure in Paris. Since 2015, he is a Gibbs
  Assistant Professor in the Applied Math Program at Yale University. One of the main
  goals of his current research at Yale is to create meaningful interaction between
  data analysis aspects of machine learning, applied mathematics, and computational
  sciences, especially in Big Data applications. His research interests include exploratory
  & high-dimensional data analysis, manifold learning, diffusion geometries, machine
  learning, and deep learning. He now has his own lab at the University of Montreal."
