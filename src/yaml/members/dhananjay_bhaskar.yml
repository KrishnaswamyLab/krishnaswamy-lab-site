about: Dhananjay Bhaskar is a postdoc in Genetics at the School of Medicine and a
  Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow. His interdisciplinary
  research combines topological data analysis, machine learning, and mathematical
  modeling with applications in biophysics and biomedical research. Previously he
  worked on quantitative analysis of pattern formation and phase transitions in active
  matter, automated embryo selection for IVF, and unsupervised methods for analyzing
  cell shape and motility in time-lapse microscopy.Dhananjay received his Ph.D. in
  Biomedical Engineering and Sc.M. in Data Science from Brown University. Prior to
  Brown, he studied Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of
  British Columbia. When he is not busy transforming coffee beans into code, Dhananjay
  enjoys hiking, swimming, and playing badminton.
