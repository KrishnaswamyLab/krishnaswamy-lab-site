about: 'Aarthi is a PhD student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale
  University. She is interested in developing improved methods to study cancer immunogenomics.
  To this end, her research focuses on machine learning and graph-based methods that
  leverage the rich properties of single-cell RNA sequencing data.Aarthi graduated
  from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics. While there, she
  performed resesarch in Dr. Ferhat Ay''s lab, where she analyzed Hi-C sequencing
  data to interpret the conserved organizational features of parasite genomes. She
  also worked with Dr. Theresa Gaasterland to study cancer genomics and structural
  variation. Over the summers, Aarthi interned at Auris Health and Regeneron, where
  she further grew her skillset in synergistic approaches to computer science and
  biological discovery.'
