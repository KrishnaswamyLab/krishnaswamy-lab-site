about: 'Danqi Liao is a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Yale University.
  Her research interests include geometric, manifold learning, and deep learning.
  Specifically, she is interested in studying the characteristics that make expressive
  and generalizable embeddings and developing efficient and principled methods to
  achieve such representations.

  Danqi graduated Magna Cum Laude from Northwestern University and obtained her master''s
  degree from Princeton University. While at Princeton, she worked on computer perception
  and video recognition in Dr. Olga Russakovsky''s lab. Before graduate school, she
  worked as a machine learning engineer at Meta for two years. Outside of research,
