about: 'Egbert Castro is a PhD student in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
  track at Yale University. He is interested in methods for learning informative and
  useful representations of biomolecules. Currently his work in the Krishnaswamy lab
  focuses on learning latent representations of graph-structured data such as miRNA
  secondary structure ensembles.

  Previously he majored in Pharmacological Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics at
  UC San Diego. While at UC San Diego, he performed research in the lab of Dr. Rommie
  Amaro applying molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics in drug discovery. After
  graduating, he interned at Genentech applying machine learning to chemical property
  prediction tasks'
