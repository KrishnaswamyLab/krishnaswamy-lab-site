about: Deep neural networks have gained immense popularity within the last decade
  due to their success in many important machine learning tasks such as image recognition,
  speech recognition, and natural language processing. This course will provide a
  principled and hands-on approach to deep learning with neural networks. By the end
  of the course, students will have mastered the principles and practices underlying
  neural networks including modern methods of deep learning, and will have applied
  deep learning methods to real-world problems including image recognition, natural
  language processing, and biomedical applications. The course will be based on homework,
  a final exam, and a final project (either group or individual, depending on the
  total number enrolled). The project will include both a written and oral (i.e. presentation)
  component. Students' grades will be based on their homework scores and the quality
  of the written and oral component of their projects. The course assumes basic prior
  knowledge in linear algebra and probability.
