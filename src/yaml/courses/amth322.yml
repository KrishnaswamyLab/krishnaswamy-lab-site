about: 'This course provides an introduction to geometric and topological methods
  in data science. Our starting point is the manifold hypothesis: that high dimensional
  data live on or near a much lower dimensional smooth manifold. We introduce tools
  to study the geometric and topological properties of this manifold in order to reveal
  relevant features and organization of the data. Topics include: metric space structures,
  curvature, geodesics, diffusion maps, eigenmaps, geometric model spaces, gradient
  descent, data embeddings and projections, and topological data analysis (TDA) in
  the form of persistence homology and their associated "barcodes." We see applications
  of these methods in a variety of data types.'
