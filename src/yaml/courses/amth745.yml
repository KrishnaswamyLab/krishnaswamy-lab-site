about: An overview of advances in the past decade in machine learning and automatic
  data-mining approaches for dealing with the broad scope of modern data-analysis
  challenges, including deep learning, kernel methods, dictionary learning, and bag
  of words/features. This year, the focus is on a broad scope of biomedical data-analysis
  tasks, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell signaling and proteomic analysis,
  health care assessment, and medical diagnosis and treatment recommendations. The
  seminar is based on student presentations and discussions of recent prominent publications
  from leading journals and conferences in the field.
