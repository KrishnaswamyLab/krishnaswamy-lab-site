about: "Sculpting the coarse readout of experimentation towards a useful embedding
  preserving the data's characteristics is a fundamental problem we undertake. Our
  methods provide the foundations of analyzing molecules for drug discovery, images
  for dynamic characterization, and networks for gaining insight from knowledge graphs.
