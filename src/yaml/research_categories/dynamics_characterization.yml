about: "The methodology employed for data acquisition can itself limit insights that be gleaned. For example
  the\nstatic snapshots of data for an otherwise continuous process. We specialize
  in \ncharacterizing data representations to provide more holistic analyses e.g.
  constructing a singular representation of these static snapshots that temporally
  respects the entire process.\n"
