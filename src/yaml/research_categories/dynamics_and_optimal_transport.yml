#   The methodology employed for data acquisition can itself limit insights that be gleaned.
  # For example the static snapshots of data for an otherwise continuous process.
  # We specialize in characterizing data representations to provide more holistic analyses 
  # e.g. constructing a singular representation of these static snapshots that temporally respects the entire process and leveraging optimal transport (OT) across applications to learn distributions. 
  # As such OT provides the means through which we can understand data dynamics.

  The data acquisition method can restrict insights gained, such as static snapshots hindering analysis of continuous processes. We specializatize in characterizing data representations, constructing a unified representation of static snapshots respecting the entire process, and leveraging optimal transport (OT) for understanding data dynamics.
