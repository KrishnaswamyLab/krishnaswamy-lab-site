publicationAbstract: TIDES or ( Trajectory Interpolated DREMI Scores) is an extension
  of our earlier Density Resampled Estimate of Mutual Information which quantifies  time-varying
  edge behavior over a developmental trajectory. In particular it tracks times during
  development in which a regulatory relationship is strong (high mutual information)
  vs times when regulatory relationships are inactive (low mutual information) due  to
  regulatory network rewiring that underlies differentiation.  We also predict an
  overall metric of edge dynamism, which combined with TIDES allows us to predict
  the effect of drug perturbations on the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition in
  breast cancer cells.
