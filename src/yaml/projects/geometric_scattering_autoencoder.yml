publicationAbstract: Biomolecular graph analysis has recently gained much attention
  in the emerging field of geometric deep learning. Here we focus on organizing biomolecular
  graphs in ways that expose meaningful relations and variations between them. We
  propose a geometric scattering autoencoder (GSAE) network for learning such graph
  embeddings. Our embedding network first extracts rich graph features using the recently
  proposed geometric scattering transform. Then, it leverages a semi-supervised variational
  autoencoder to extract a low-dimensional embedding that retains the information
  in these features that enable prediction of molecular properties as well as characterize
  graphs. We show that GSAE organizes RNA graphs both by structure and energy, accurately
  reflecting bistable RNA structures. Also, the model is generative and can sample
  new folding trajectories.
