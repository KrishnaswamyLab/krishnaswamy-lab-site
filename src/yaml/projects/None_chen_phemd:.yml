  abstract: 'Previously, the effect of a drug on a cell population was measured based
    on simple metrics such as cell viability. However, as single-cell technologies
    are becoming more advanced, drug screen experiments can now be conducted with
    more complex readouts such as gene expression profiles of individual cells. The
    increasing complexity of measurements from these multi-sample experiments calls
    for more sophisticated analytical approaches than are currently available.

    We develop a novel method called PhEMD (Phenotypic Earth Mover''s Distance) and
    show that it can be used to embed the space of drug perturbations on the basis
    of the drugs'' effects on cell populations. When testing PhEMD on a newly-generated,
    300-sample CyTOF kinase inhibition screen experiment, we find that the state space
    of the perturbation conditions is surprisingly low-dimensional and that the network
    of drugs demonstrates manifold structure.

    We show that because of the fairly simple manifold geometry of the 300 samples,
    we can accurately capture the full range of drug effects using a dictionary of
    only 30 experimental conditions. We also show that new drugs can be added to our
    PhEMD embedding using similarities inferred from other characterizations of drugs
    using a technique called Nystrom extension.

    Our findings suggest that large-scale drug screens can be conducted by measuring
    only a small fraction of the drugs using the most expensive high-throughput single-cell
    technologies -- the effects of other drugs may be inferred by mapping and extending
    the perturbation space. We additionally show that PhEMD can be useful for analyzing
    other types of single-cell samples, such as patient tumor biopsies, by mapping
    the patient state space in a similar way as the drug state space.

    We demonstrate that PhEMD is highly scalable, compatible with leading batch effect
    correction techniques, and generalizable to multiple experimental designs. Altogether,
    our analyses suggest that PhEMD may facilitate drug discovery efforts and help
    uncover the network geometry of a collection of single-cell samples.'
