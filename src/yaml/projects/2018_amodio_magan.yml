  abstract: 'It is increasingly common in many types of natural and physical systems
    (especially biological systems) to have different types of measurements  performed
    on the same underlying system. In such settings, it is important to align the
    manifolds arising from each measurement in order  to integrate such data and gain
    an improved picture of the system; we tackle this problem using generative adversarial
    networks (GANs). Recent attempts to use GANs to find correspondences between sets
    of samples do not explicitly perform proper alignment of manifolds.

    We present the new Manifold Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such
    that related points in each measurement space are aligned. We demonstrate  applications
    of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different measurement types
    together: cells from the same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell
    RNA-sequencing) and proteomic (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that MAGAN
    successfully aligns manifolds such that known correlations between measured markers
    are improved compared to other recently proposed models.'
