projectAbbreviation: SUGAR
projectListDescription: A new kind of data generation algorithm that generates of
  data geometry rather than density and is able to generate data in sparse regions
  and predicts hypothetical data points.

publicationAbstract: 'Many generative models attempt to replicate the density of their
  input data. However, this approach is often undesirable, since data density is highly
  affected by sampling biases, noise, and artifacts. We propose a method called SUGAR
  (Synthesis Using Geometrically Aligned Random-walks) that uses a diffusion process
  to learn a manifold geometry from the data. Then, it generates new points evenly
  along the manifold by pulling randomly generated points into its intrinsic structure
  using a diffusion kernel.

  SUGAR equalizes the density along the manifold by selectively generating points
  in sparse areas of the manifold. We demonstrate how the approach corrects sampling
  biases and artifacts, while also revealing intrinsic patterns (e.g. progression)
  and relations in the data. The method is applicable for correcting missing data,
  finding hypothetical data points, and learning relationships between data features.'
