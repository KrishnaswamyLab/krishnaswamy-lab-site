projectListDescription: Capturing meaningful biological signals in high-dimensional
  data using a continuous coarse-graining process which can be used to produce both
  a high-level summarization and more detailed representations of the data.

publicationAbstract: "As the biomedical community produces datasets that are increasingly
  complex and high dimensional, there is a need for more sophisticated computational
  tools to extract biological insights. We present Multiscale PHATE, a method that
  sweeps through all levels of data granularity to learn abstracted biological features
  directly predictive of disease outcome. Built on a coarse-graining process called
  diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE learns a data topology that can be analyzed
  at coarse resolutions for high-level summarizations of data and at fine resolutions
  for detailed representations of subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to a coronavirus
  disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset with 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients
  and find that patients who die show CD16hiCD66blo neutrophil and IFN-\u03B3+ granzyme
  B+ Th17 cell responses. We also show that population groupings from Multiscale PHATE
  directly fed into a classifier predict disease outcome more accurately than naive
  featurizations of the data. Multiscale PHATE is broadly generalizable to different
  data types, including flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell
  sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), and clinical
  variables."
