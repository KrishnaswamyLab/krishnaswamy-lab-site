publicationAbstract: 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology
  for gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed from fMRI
  measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over time. However, analysing
  such data presents a challenge due to the large degree of noise and person-to-person
  variation in how information is represented in the brain.

  To address this challenge, we present a novel topological approach that encodes
  each time point in an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological features,
  i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation naturally does
  not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust towards noise. We show that
  these time-varying persistence diagrams can be clustered to find meaningful groupings
  between participants, and that they are also useful in studying within-subject brain
  state trajectories of subjects performing a particular task.

  In our preprint, we apply both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to
  a group of participants watching the movie ''Partly Cloudy''. We observe significant
  differences in both brain state trajectories and overall topological activity between
  adults and children watching the same movie.

  See below for an overview of our workflow.'
