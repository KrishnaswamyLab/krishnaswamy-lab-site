publicationAbstract: In modern relational machine learning it is common to encounter
  large graphs that arise via interactions or similarities between observations in
  many domains. Further, in many cases the target entities for analysis are actually
  signals on such graphs. We propose to compare and organize such datasets of graph
  signals by using an earth mover's distance (EMD) with a geodesic cost over the underlying
  graph. Typically, EMD is computed by optimizing over the cost of transporting one
  probability distribution to another over an underlying metric space. However, this
  is inefficient when computing the EMD between many signals. Here, we propose an
  unbalanced graph earth mover's distance that efficiently embeds the unbalanced EMD
  on an underlying graph into an L1 space, whose metric we call unbalanced diffusion
  earth mover's distance (UDEMD). This leads us to an efficient nearest neighbors
  kernel over many signals defined on a large graph. Next, we show how this gives
  distances between graph signals that are robust to noise. Finally, we apply this
  to organizing patients based on clinical notes who are modelled as signals on the
  SNOMED-CT medical knowledge graph, embedding lymphoblast cells modeled as signals
  on a gene graph, and organizing genes modeled as signals over a large peripheral
  blood mononuclear (PBMC) cell graph. In each case, we show that UDEMD-based embeddings
  find accurate distances that are highly efficient compared to other methods.
