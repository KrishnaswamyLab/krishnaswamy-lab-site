  title: Diffusion Earth Mover's Distance and Distribution Embeddings
  abstract: "We propose a new fast method of measuring distances between large numbers
    of related high dimensional datasets called the Diffusion Earth Mover's Distance
    (EMD). We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data graph that
    is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In such cases
    where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed manifold,
    we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with
    a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time
    and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We
    also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future
    uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we
    demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from
    210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can
    derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders
    of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between
    patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure
    and heterogeneity in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to
    all datasets that are massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological
    systems."
