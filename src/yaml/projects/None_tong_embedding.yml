  abstract: In modern relational machine learning it is common to encounter large
    graphs that arise via interactions or similarities between observations in many
    domains. Further, in many cases the target entities for analysis are actually
    signals on such graphs. We propose to compare and organize such datasets of graph
    signals by using an earth mover's distance (EMD) with a geodesic cost over the
    underlying graph. Typically, EMD is computed by optimizing over the cost of transporting
    one probability distribution to another over an underlying metric space. However,
    this is inefficient when computing the EMD between many signals. Here, we propose
    an unbalanced graph earth mover's distance that efficiently embeds the unbalanced
    EMD on an underlying graph into an L1 space, whose metric we call unbalanced diffusion
    earth mover's distance (UDEMD). This leads us to an efficient nearest neighbors
    kernel over many signals defined on a large graph. Next, we show how this gives
    distances between graph signals that are robust to noise. Finally, we apply this
    to organizing patients based on clinical notes who are modelled as signals on
    the SNOMED-CT medical knowledge graph, embedding lymphoblast cells modeled as
    signals on a gene graph, and organizing genes modeled as signals over a large
    peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cell graph. In each case, we show that UDEMD-based
    embeddings find accurate distances that are highly efficient compared to other
    methods.
