projectAbbreviation: DEMD
projectListDescription: a fast multi-scale approximation of the Earth Mover's Distance
  with manifold geodesics as a ground distance between distributions on a manifold.
projectTitle: Diffusion Earth Mover's Distance and Distribution Embeddings
projectUrl: demd
publicationAbstract: "We propose a new fast method of measuring distances between
  large numbers of related high dimensional datasets called the Diffusion Earth Mover's
  Distance (EMD). We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data
  graph that is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In
  such cases where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed
  manifold, we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard
  EMD with a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in $\tilde{O}(n)$
  time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs.
  We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future
  uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate
  an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19
  patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances
  between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster
  than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded
  into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity
  in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are
  massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological systems."
