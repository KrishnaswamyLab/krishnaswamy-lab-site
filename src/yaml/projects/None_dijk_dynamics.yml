description: A neural network framework for learning stochastic dynamics for generative
  and embedding purposes. DyMoN serves as a deep model that itself embodies a dynamic
  system such that the gene logic and features driving the system can be studied.

  abstract: 'Biological data often contains measurements of dynamic entities such
    as cells or organisms in various states of progression. However, biological systems
    are notoriously difficult to describe analytically due to their many interacting
    components, and in many cases, the technical challenge of taking longitudinal
    measurements.

    This leads to difficulties in studying the features of the dynamics, for examples
    the drivers of the transition. To address this problem, we present a deep neural
    network framework we call Dynamics Modeling Network or DyMoN. DyMoN is a neural
    network framework trained as a deep generative Markov model whose next state is
    a probability distribution based on the current state.

    DyMoN is well-suited to the idiosyncrasies of biological data, including noise,
    sparsity, and the lack of longitudinal measurements in many types of systems.
    Thus, DyMoN can be trained using probability distributions derived from the data
    in any way, such as trajectories derived via dimensionality reduction methods,
    and does not require longitudinal measurements.

    We show the advantage of learning deep models over shallow models such as Kalman
    filters and hidden Markov models that do not learn representations of the data,
    both in terms of learning embeddings of the data and also in terms training efficiency,
    accuracy and ability to multitask. We perform three case studies of applying DyMoN
    to different types of biological systems and extracting features of the dynamics
    in each case by examining the learned model.'
