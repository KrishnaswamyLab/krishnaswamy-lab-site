publicationAbstract: "We present a method called Manifold Interpolating Optimal-Transport
  Flow (MIOFlow) that learns stochastic, continuous population dynamics from static
  snapshot samples taken at sporadic timepoints. MIOFlow combines dynamic models,
  manifold learning, and optimal transport by training neural ordinary differential
  equations (Neural ODE) to interpolate between static population snapshots as penalized
  by optimal transport with manifold ground distance. Further, we ensure that the
  flow follows the geometry by operating in the latent space of an autoencoder that
  we call a geodesic autoencoder (GAE). In GAE the latent space distance between points
  is regularized to match a novel multiscale geodesic distance on the data manifold
  that we define. We show that this method is superior to normalizing flows, Schr\xF6dinger
  bridges and other generative models that are designed to flow from noise to data
  in terms of interpolating between populations. Theoretically, we link these trajectories
  with dynamic optimal transport. We evaluate our method on simulated data with bifurcations
  and merges, as well as scRNA-seq data from embryoid body differentiation, and acute
  myeloid leukemia treatment."
