projectAbbreviation: PHATE
projectListDescription: a visualization and dimensionality reduction technique that
  is sensitive to local and global relationships and successfully preserves structures
  of interest in biological data including cluster structure and branching trajectory
  structure.
projectTitle: Potential of Heat-diffusion Affinity-based Transition Embedding
projectUrl: phate
publicationAbstract: 'In the era of ''Big Data'' there is a pressing need for tools
  that provide human interpretable visualizations of emergent patterns in high-throughput
  high-dimensional data. Further, to enable insightful data exploration, such visualizations
  should faithfully capture and emphasize emergent structures and patterns without
  enforcing prior assumptions on the shape or form of the data.

  In this paper, we present PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based
  Transition Embedding) - an unsupervised low-dimensional embedding for visualization
  of data that is aimed at solving these issues. Unlike previous methods that are
  commonly used for visualization, such as PCA and tSNE, PHATE is able to capture
  and highlight both local and global structure in the data.'
