  abstract: 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology
    for gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed from fMRI
    measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over time. However, analysing
    such data presents a challenge due to the large degree of noise and person-to-person
    variation in how information is represented in the brain.

    To address this challenge, we present a novel topological approach that encodes
    each time point in an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological features,
    i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation naturally
    does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust towards noise. We
    show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be clustered to find meaningful
    groupings between participants, and that they are also useful in studying within-subject
    brain state trajectories of subjects performing a particular task.

    In our preprint, we apply both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to
    a group of participants watching the movie ''Partly Cloudy''. We observe significant
    differences in both brain state trajectories and overall topological activity
    between adults and children watching the same movie.

    See below for an overview of our workflow.'
