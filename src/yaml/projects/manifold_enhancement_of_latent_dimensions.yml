projectAbbreviation: MELD
projectListDescription: a graph signal processing tool to analyze multiple scRNA-seq
  samples from two or more conditions.
projectTitle: Manifold Enhancement of Latent Dimensions
projectUrl: meld
publicationAbstract: Current methods for comparing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets
  collected in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional
  state space, such as clusters of cells. Here we quantify the effects of perturbations
  at the single-cell level using a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation
  across the transcriptomic space. We describe this space as a manifold and develop
  a relative likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental
  conditions using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used to
  identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop
  vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level
  of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm
  at identifying clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition
  is, on average, 57% higher than the next-best-performing algorithm tested. Gene
  signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate than those of six alternative
  algorithms in ground truth comparisons.
