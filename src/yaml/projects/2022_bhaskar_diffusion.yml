description: a method for computing diffusion-based curvature on high-dimensional
  data that hinges on the canonical data diffusion framework. Allows for estimation
  of neural network Hessians as well as curvature-based inference on point cloud data
  such as single-cell data.

  abstract: We introduce a new intrinsic measure of local curvature on point-cloud
    data called diffusion curvature. Our measure uses the framework of diffusion maps,
    including the data diffusion operator, to structure point cloud data and define
    local curvature based on the laziness of a random walk starting at a point or
    region of the data. We show that this laziness directly relates to volume comparison
    results from Riemannian geometry. We then extend this scalar curvature notion
    to an entire quadratic form using neural network estimations based on the diffusion
    map of point-cloud data. We show applications of both estimations on toy data,
    single-cell data and on estimating local Hessian matrices of neural network loss
    landscapes.
