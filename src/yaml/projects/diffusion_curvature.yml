projectListDescription: a method for computing diffusion-based curvature on high-dimensional
  data that hinges on the canonical data diffusion framework. Allows for estimation
  of neural network Hessians as well as curvature-based inference on point cloud data
  such as single-cell data.
projectTitle: Diffusion Curvature
projectUrl: diffusion_curvature
publicationAbstract: We introduce a new intrinsic measure of local curvature on point-cloud
  data called diffusion curvature. Our measure uses the framework of diffusion maps,
  including the data diffusion operator, to structure point cloud data and define
  local curvature based on the laziness of a random walk starting at a point or region
  of the data. We show that this laziness directly relates to volume comparison results
  from Riemannian geometry. We then extend this scalar curvature notion to an entire
  quadratic form using neural network estimations based on the diffusion map of point-cloud
  data. We show applications of both estimations on toy data, single-cell data and
  on estimating local Hessian matrices of neural network loss landscapes.
