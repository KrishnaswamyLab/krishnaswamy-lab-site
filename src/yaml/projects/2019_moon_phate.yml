description: a visualization and dimensionality reduction technique that is sensitive
  to local and global relationships and successfully preserves structures of interest
  in biological data including cluster structure and branching trajectory structure.

  abstract: 'In the era of ''Big Data'' there is a pressing need for tools that provide
    human interpretable visualizations of emergent patterns in high-throughput high-dimensional
    data. Further, to enable insightful data exploration, such visualizations should
    faithfully capture and emphasize emergent structures and patterns without enforcing
    prior assumptions on the shape or form of the data.

    In this paper, we present PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based
    Transition Embedding) - an unsupervised low-dimensional embedding for visualization
    of data that is aimed at solving these issues. Unlike previous methods that are
    commonly used for visualization, such as PCA and tSNE, PHATE is able to capture
    and highlight both local and global structure in the data.'
