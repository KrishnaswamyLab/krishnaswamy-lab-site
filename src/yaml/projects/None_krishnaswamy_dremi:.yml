  abstract: "Cellular circuits sense the environment, process signals, and compute
    decisions using networks of interacting proteins. To model such a system, the
    abundance of each activated protein species can be described as a stochastic function
    of the abundance of other proteins. High-dimensional single-cell technologies,
    like mass cytometry, offer an opportunity to characterize signaling circuit-wide.
    However, the challenge of developing and applying computational approaches to
    interpret such complex data remains.\nHere, we developed computational methods,
    based on established statistical concepts, to characterize signaling network relationships
    by quantifying the strengths of network edges and deriving signaling response
    functions. In comparing signaling between na\xEFve and antigen-exposed CD4+ T-lymphocytes,
    we find that although these two cell subtypes had similarly-wired networks, na\xEFve
    cells transmitted more information along a key signaling cascade than did antigen-exposed
    cells.\nWe validated our characterization on mice lacking the extracellular-regulated
    MAP kinase (ERK2), which showed stronger influence of pERK on pS6 (phosphorylated-ribosomal
    protein S6), in na\xEFve cells compared to antigen-exposed cells, as predicted.
    We demonstrate that by using cell-to-cell variation inherent in single cell data,
    we can algorithmically derive response functions underlying molecular circuits
    and drive the understanding of how cells process signals."
