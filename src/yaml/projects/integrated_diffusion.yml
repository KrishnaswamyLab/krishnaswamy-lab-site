  operator to effectively visualize the relationships between them.
projectTitle: Integrated Diffusion
projectUrl: integrated_diffusion
publicationAbstract: We propose a method called integrated diffusion for combining
  multimodal data, gathered via different sensors on the same system, to create a
  integrated data diffusion operator. As real world data suffers from both local and
  global noise, we introduce mechanisms to optimally calculate a diffusion operator
  that reflects the combined information in data by maintaining low frequency eigenvectors
  of each modality both globally and locally. We show the utility of this integrated
  operator in denoising and visualizing multimodal toy data as well as multi-omic
  data generated from blood cells, measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility.
  Our approach better visualizes the geometry of the integrated data and captures
  known cross-modality associations. More generally, integrated diffusion is broadly
  applicable to multimodal datasets generated by noisy sensors collected in a variety
  of fields.
