projectAbbreviation: MAGIC
projectListDescription: an algorithm that uses graph signal processing for denoising
  and missing transcript recovery in single cell RNA sequencing. MAGIC successfully
  recovers gene-gene relationships from data and allows for the prediction of transcription
  targets.

projectUrl: magic
publicationAbstract: 'Single-cell RNA-sequencing is fast becoming a major technology
  that is  revolutionizing biological discovery in fields such as development, immunology
  and cancer. The ability to simultaneously measure thousands of genes at single cell
  resolution allows, among other prospects, for the possibility of learning gene regulatory
  networks at large scales. However, scRNA-seq technologies suffer from many sources
  of significant technical noise, the most prominent of which is dropout due to inefficient
  mRNA capture. This results in data that has a high degree of sparsity, with typically
  only 10% non-zero values.

  To address this, we developed MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells),
  a method for imputing missing values, and restoring the structure of the data. After
  MAGIC, we find that two- and three-dimensional gene interactions are restored and
  that MAGIC is able to impute complex and non-linear shapes of interactions. MAGIC
  also retains cluster structure, enhances cluster-specific gene interactions and
  restores trajectories, as demonstrated in mouse retinal bipolar cells, hematopoiesis,
  and our newly generated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition dataset.'
