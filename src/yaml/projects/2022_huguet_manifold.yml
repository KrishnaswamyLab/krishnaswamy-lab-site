  abstract: "We present a method called Manifold Interpolating Optimal-Transport Flow
    (MIOFlow) that learns stochastic, continuous population dynamics from static snapshot
    samples taken at sporadic timepoints. MIOFlow combines dynamic models, manifold
    learning, and optimal transport by training neural ordinary differential equations
    (Neural ODE) to interpolate between static population snapshots as penalized by
    optimal transport with manifold ground distance. Further, we ensure that the flow
    follows the geometry by operating in the latent space of an autoencoder that we
    call a geodesic autoencoder (GAE). In GAE the latent space distance between points
    is regularized to match a novel multiscale geodesic distance on the data manifold
    that we define. We show that this method is superior to normalizing flows, Schr\xF6dinger
    bridges and other generative models that are designed to flow from noise to data
    in terms of interpolating between populations. Theoretically, we link these trajectories
    with dynamic optimal transport. We evaluate our method on simulated data with
    bifurcations and merges, as well as scRNA-seq data from embryoid body differentiation,
    and acute myeloid leukemia treatment."
