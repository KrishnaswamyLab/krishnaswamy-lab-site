description: A new kind of data generation algorithm that generates of data geometry
  rather than density and is able to generate data in sparse regions and predicts
  hypothetical data points.

  abstract: 'Many generative models attempt to replicate the density of their input
    data. However, this approach is often undesirable, since data density is highly
    affected by sampling biases, noise, and artifacts. We propose a method called
    SUGAR (Synthesis Using Geometrically Aligned Random-walks) that uses a diffusion
    process to learn a manifold geometry from the data. Then, it generates new points
    evenly along the manifold by pulling randomly generated points into its intrinsic
    structure using a diffusion kernel.

    SUGAR equalizes the density along the manifold by selectively generating points
    in sparse areas of the manifold. We demonstrate how the approach corrects sampling
    biases and artifacts, while also revealing intrinsic patterns (e.g. progression)
    and relations in the data. The method is applicable for correcting missing data,
    finding hypothetical data points, and learning relationships between data features.'
