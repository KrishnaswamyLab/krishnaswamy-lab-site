  abstract: Biomolecular graph analysis has recently gained much attention in the
    emerging field of geometric deep learning. Here we focus on organizing biomolecular
    graphs in ways that expose meaningful relations and variations between them. We
    propose a geometric scattering autoencoder (GSAE) network for learning such graph
    embeddings. Our embedding network first extracts rich graph features using the
    recently proposed geometric scattering transform. Then, it leverages a semi-supervised
    variational autoencoder to extract a low-dimensional embedding that retains the
    information in these features that enable prediction of molecular properties as
    well as characterize graphs. We show that GSAE organizes RNA graphs both by structure
    and energy, accurately reflecting bistable RNA structures. Also, the model is
    generative and can sample new folding trajectories.
