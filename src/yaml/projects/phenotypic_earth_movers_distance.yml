publicationAbstract: 'Previously, the effect of a drug on a cell population was measured
  based on simple metrics such as cell viability. However, as single-cell technologies
  are becoming more advanced, drug screen experiments can now be conducted with more
  complex readouts such as gene expression profiles of individual cells. The increasing
  complexity of measurements from these multi-sample experiments calls for more sophisticated
  analytical approaches than are currently available.

  We develop a novel method called PhEMD (Phenotypic Earth Mover''s Distance) and
  show that it can be used to embed the space of drug perturbations on the basis of
  the drugs'' effects on cell populations. When testing PhEMD on a newly-generated,
  300-sample CyTOF kinase inhibition screen experiment, we find that the state space
  of the perturbation conditions is surprisingly low-dimensional and that the network
  of drugs demonstrates manifold structure.

  We show that because of the fairly simple manifold geometry of the 300 samples,
  we can accurately capture the full range of drug effects using a dictionary of only
  30 experimental conditions. We also show that new drugs can be added to our PhEMD
  embedding using similarities inferred from other characterizations of drugs using
  a technique called Nystrom extension.

  Our findings suggest that large-scale drug screens can be conducted by measuring
  only a small fraction of the drugs using the most expensive high-throughput single-cell
  technologies -- the effects of other drugs may be inferred by mapping and extending
  the perturbation space. We additionally show that PhEMD can be useful for analyzing
  other types of single-cell samples, such as patient tumor biopsies, by mapping the
  patient state space in a similar way as the drug state space.

  We demonstrate that PhEMD is highly scalable, compatible with leading batch effect
  correction techniques, and generalizable to multiple experimental designs. Altogether,
  our analyses suggest that PhEMD may facilitate drug discovery efforts and help uncover
  the network geometry of a collection of single-cell samples.'
