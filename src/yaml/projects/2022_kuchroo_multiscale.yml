  abstract: "As the biomedical community produces datasets that are increasingly complex
    and high dimensional, there is a need for more sophisticated computational tools
    to extract biological insights. We present Multiscale PHATE, a method that sweeps
    through all levels of data granularity to learn abstracted biological features
    directly predictive of disease outcome. Built on a coarse-graining process called
    diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE learns a data topology that can be analyzed
    at coarse resolutions for high-level summarizations of data and at fine resolutions
    for detailed representations of subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to a coronavirus
    disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset with 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients
    and find that patients who die show CD16hiCD66blo neutrophil and IFN-\u03B3+ granzyme
    B+ Th17 cell responses. We also show that population groupings from Multiscale
    PHATE directly fed into a classifier predict disease outcome more accurately than
    naive featurizations of the data. Multiscale PHATE is broadly generalizable to
    different data types, including flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq),
    single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq),
    and clinical variables."
