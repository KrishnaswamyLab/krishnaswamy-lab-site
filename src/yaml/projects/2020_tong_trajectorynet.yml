  dynamic optimal transport to perform continuous optimal transport in high dimensions
  in the neural network framework. Uses dynamic optimal transport to infer continuous

  abstract: It is increasingly common to encounter data from dynamic processes captured
    by static cross-sectional measurements over time, particularly in biomedical settings.
    Recent attempts to model individual trajectories from this data use optimal transport
    to create pairwise matchings between time points. However, these methods cannot
    model continuous dynamics and non-linear paths that entities can take in these
    systems. To address this issue, we establish a link between continuous normalizing
    flows and dynamic optimal transport, that allows us to model the expected paths
    of points over time. Continuous normalizing flows are generally under constrained,
    as they are allowed to take an arbitrary path from the source to the target distribution.
    We present {TrajectoryNet}, which controls the continuous paths taken between
    distributions to produce dynamic optimal transport. We show how this is particularly
    applicable for studying cellular dynamics in data from single-cell RNA sequencing
    (scRNA-seq) technologies, and that TrajectoryNet improves upon recently proposed
    static optimal transport-based models that can be used for interpolating cellular
    distributions.
