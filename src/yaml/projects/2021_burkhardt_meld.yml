  abstract: Current methods for comparing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets collected
    in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state
    space, such as clusters of cells. Here we quantify the effects of perturbations
    at the single-cell level using a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation
    across the transcriptomic space. We describe this space as a manifold and develop
    a relative likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental
    conditions using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used
    to identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also
    develop vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at
    the level of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy
    of our algorithm at identifying clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted
    in each condition is, on average, 57% higher than the next-best-performing algorithm
    tested. Gene signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate than those
    of six alternative algorithms in ground truth comparisons.
