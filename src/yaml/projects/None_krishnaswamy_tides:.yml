  abstract: TIDES or ( Trajectory Interpolated DREMI Scores) is an extension of our
    earlier Density Resampled Estimate of Mutual Information which quantifies  time-varying
    edge behavior over a developmental trajectory. In particular it tracks times during
    development in which a regulatory relationship is strong (high mutual information)
    vs times when regulatory relationships are inactive (low mutual information) due  to
    regulatory network rewiring that underlies differentiation.  We also predict an
    overall metric of edge dynamism, which combined with TIDES allows us to predict
    the effect of drug perturbations on the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition in
    breast cancer cells.
