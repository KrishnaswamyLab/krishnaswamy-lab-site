description: a neural network inference method which maps between datasets with the
  signal learned on a subset of the data, for example when a drug perturbation is
  applied to one cell type neuron editing can be used to apply it in silico to another
  cell type.

  abstract: 'While neural networks can be trained to map from one specific dataset
    to another, they usually do not learn a generalized transformation that can extrapolate
    accurately outside the space of training. For instance, a generative adversarial
    network (GAN) exclusively trained to transform images of cars from light to dark
    might not have the same effect on images of horses. This is because neural networks
    are good at generation within the manifold of the data that they are trained on.
    However, generating new samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating "out-of-sample"
    is a much harder problem that has been less well studied.

    To address this, we introduce a technique called neuron editing that learns how
    neurons encode an edit for a particular transformation in a latent space. We use
    an autoencoder to decompose the variation within the dataset into activations
    of different neurons and generate transformed data by defining an editing transformation
    on those neurons.

    By performing the transformation in a latent trained space, we encode fairly complex
    and non-linear transformations to the data with much simpler distribution shifts
    to the neuron''s activations. We showcase our technique on image domain/style
    transfer and two biological applications: removal of batch artifacts representing
    unwanted noise and modeling the effect of drug treatments to predict synergy between
    drugs.'
