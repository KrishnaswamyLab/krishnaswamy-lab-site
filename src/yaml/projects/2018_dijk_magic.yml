description: an algorithm that uses graph signal processing for denoising and missing
  transcript recovery in single cell RNA sequencing. MAGIC successfully recovers gene-gene
  relationships from data and allows for the prediction of transcription targets.

  abstract: 'Single-cell RNA-sequencing is fast becoming a major technology that is  revolutionizing
    biological discovery in fields such as development, immunology and cancer. The
    ability to simultaneously measure thousands of genes at single cell resolution
    allows, among other prospects, for the possibility of learning gene regulatory
    networks at large scales. However, scRNA-seq technologies suffer from many sources
    of significant technical noise, the most prominent of which is dropout due to
    inefficient mRNA capture. This results in data that has a high degree of sparsity,
    with typically only 10% non-zero values.

    To address this, we developed MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of
    Cells), a method for imputing missing values, and restoring the structure of the
    data. After MAGIC, we find that two- and three-dimensional gene interactions are
    restored and that MAGIC is able to impute complex and non-linear shapes of interactions.
    MAGIC also retains cluster structure, enhances cluster-specific gene interactions
    and restores trajectories, as demonstrated in mouse retinal bipolar cells, hematopoiesis,
    and our newly generated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition dataset.'
