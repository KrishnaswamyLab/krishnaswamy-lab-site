projectListDescription: a dual GAN (generative adversarial network) framework that
  can find correspondences between two data modalities measuring the same system to
  create an integrated dataset

publicationAbstract: 'It is increasingly common in many types of natural and physical
  systems (especially biological systems) to have different types of measurements  performed
  on the same underlying system. In such settings, it is important to align the manifolds
  arising from each measurement in order  to integrate such data and gain an improved
  picture of the system; we tackle this problem using generative adversarial networks
  (GANs). Recent attempts to use GANs to find correspondences between sets of samples
  do not explicitly perform proper alignment of manifolds.

  We present the new Manifold Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such
  that related points in each measurement space are aligned. We demonstrate  applications
  of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different measurement types together:
  cells from the same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell RNA-sequencing)
  and proteomic (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that MAGAN successfully aligns
  manifolds such that known correlations between measured markers are improved compared
  to other recently proposed models.'
